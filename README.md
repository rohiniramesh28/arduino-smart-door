This project is an automatic smart door system built using:

- Ultrasonic sensor (distance detection)
- DHT11 sensor (temperature & humidity)
- Servo motor (to open/close door)
- I2C LCD display
- Red/Green LEDs (door status indicators)

## Features
- Automatically opens the door if someone is within 20cm
- Displays temperature and humidity on LCD
